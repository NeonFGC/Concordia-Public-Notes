For a thousand years, Pentara has been the crossroads of trade, faith, and politics. Built where the Grand Council of Five meet, its walls are etched with every treaty signed in blood or ink.

As old as Concordia itself, the origins of the city are lost, but as long as there are records, there are mentions of the great city of Pentara. Little remains of the original city, as repairs and construction are constantly ongoing in order to facilitate the growing population. 

Bisecting the city is the river Silvermere, a bustling shipping lane vital for trade. The upper side of the city, north of the lake, are the following districts:
- Administrative - Home to the council chambers, as well as the city watch headquarters
- Noble - Home to many of the great houses, and other rich families
- Merchant - A bustling set of markets, and small side streets with many shops
- Dock - Near the merchant district, the docks and warehouses are vital to trade
- Temple - The holy district, home to the main faiths churches
- Academic - On the opposite side of the city to the temple, this is a place of learning
- Shadow - A small district close to the merchant district

South of the lake are where most of the people live, in the following districts:
- Residential - Home to most of the inhabitants, 
- Agriculture - Sprawling farms and fields of wheat
- Entertainment - Plenty of bars, taverns, theatres and more
