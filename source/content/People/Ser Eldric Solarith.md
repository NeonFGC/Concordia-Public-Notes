The living ideal of [[The Order of the Sun]]. Towering and Broad-shouldered, his golden-bronze skin catches the light like burnished metal, with hair the pale hue of early dawn. His eyes, burning amber, flecked with molten white.

He carries the Dawnspear, the ancient weapon of [[House Solarith]], on which are engraved the words *"Have Mercy on Those we send to You"*.
