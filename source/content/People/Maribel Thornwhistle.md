A halfling woman in her late 50s, Maribel owns and runs [[The Cloak and Coin]].
She has a warm, rounded face that makes her seem younger than her years.
Her hair is chestnut, streaked with silver, and pinned back with a quill.
She wars a layered skirt and a embraided vest of very fine make.

Motherly and warm, she treats her guests as though they are her family, and always has a pot of tea on the stove. She is the adopted mother of [[Tessa]], whom she dotes on.
