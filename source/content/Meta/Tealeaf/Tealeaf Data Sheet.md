Subclass: College of Spirits

Origin Feat: Skilled

HP: 27

AC: 14

# Skilled
You gain proficiency in any combination of three skills or tools of your choice.

**Repeatable.** You can take this feat more than once
# Gnome (Rock)
### Darkvision. 
You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
### Gnomish Cunning.
You have Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.
### Gnomish Lineage.
You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose one of the following options; whichever one you choose, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage):
### Rock Gnome. 
You know the [Mending](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:mending) and [Prestidigitation](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:prestidigitation) cantrips. In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting Prestidigitation to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5,1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a Utilize action.
# Level 1
### Bardic Inspiration.
You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

**Using Bardic Inspiration.** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.

**Number of Uses.** You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**At Higher Levels.** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.
### Spellcasting.
You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the [Bard spell list](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/bard:spell-list) later in the class's description.

**Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. [Dancing Lights](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:dancing-lights) and [Vicious Mockery](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:vicious-mockery) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. [Charm Person](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:charm-person), [Color Spray](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:color-spray), [Dissonant Whispers](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:dissonant-whispers), and [Healing Word](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:healing-word) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.
# Level 2
### Expertise.
You gain Expertise (see the rules glossary) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them. (Deception and Performance)
At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.
### Jack of All Trades
You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn't otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.
# Level 3
### Guiding Whispers.
At 3rd level, you can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the [Guidance](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:guidance) cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of bard cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 60 feet when you cast it.

### Spiritual Focus.
At 3rd level, you employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes. You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells: a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarokka deck.

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a bard spell that deals damage or restores hit points through the Spiritual Focus, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus to one damage or healing roll of the spell equal to the number rolled

### Tales from Beyond.
At 3rd level, you reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and draw one Major Arcana card from your Tarot deck to determine the tale the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale’s effect or you finish a short or long rest.

You can use an action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale’s effect. Once you do so, you can’t bestow the tale’s effect again until you roll it again.

You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale.

If the tale requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.

[[Tales of the Major Arcana]]

# Level 4
### Feat: Fey Touched
**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Fey Magic.** Choose one level 1 spell from the Divination or Enchantment school of magic. You always have that spell and the [Misty Step](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step) spell prepared. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
# Level 5
### Font of Inspiration
You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.
