# Magic Initiate (Cleric)

##### Two Cantrips.
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [Cleric](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/cleric:spell-list), [Druid](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/druid:spell-list), or [Wizard](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/wizard:spell-list) spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feat's spells (choose when you select this feat).
##### Level 1 Spell.
Choose a level 1 spell from the same list you selected for this feat's cantrips. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.
##### Spell Change.
Whenever you gain a new level, you can replace one of the spells you chose for this feat with a different spell of the same level from the chosen spell list.
##### Repeatable.
You can take this feat more than once, but you must choose a different spell list each time.
# Human
##### Resourceful.
You gain Heroic Inspiration whenever you finish a Long Rest.
##### Skillful.
You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.
##### Versatile: Savage Attacker.
You've trained to deal particularly damaging strikes. Once per turn when you hit a target with a weapon, you can roll the weapon's damage dice twice and use either roll against the target.

# Level 1
##### Lay On Hands.
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.
##### Spellcasting.
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See Chapter 7 for the rules on Spellcasting. The Information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the [Paladin spell list](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/paladin:spell-list) later in the class's description.

**Spell Slots.** The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. [Heroism](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:heroism) and [Searing Smite](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:searing-smite) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Paladin spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

##### Weapon Mastery.
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For Example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.
# Level 2
##### Fighting Style: Dueling. 
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
##### Paladin's Smite.
You always have the [Divine Smite](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:divine-smite) spell prepared.  
You can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it this way again.
# Level 3
##### Channel Divinity.
You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.

You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting Feature.

**Divine Sense.** As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [Hallow](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:hallow) spell.

##### Oath of Vengeance Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Vengeance Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Vow of Enmity
When you take the Attack action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You have Advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.

If the creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the vow ends, you can transfer the vow to a different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no action required).

# Level 4
##### Feat: Heavy Armor Master.
**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Constitution or Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Damage Reduction.** When you're hit by an attack while you're wearing Heavy armor, any Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage dealt to you by that attack is reduced by an amount equal to your Proficiency Bonus.
