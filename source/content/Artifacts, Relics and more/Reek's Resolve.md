_Weapon (quartserstaff), legendary (requires attunement)_

An ancient staff kept on display in the armoury of [[House Vaeloras]].

**_Tortle Memory._** Wielding this weapon triggers memories of techniques long past down from previous Quartztophers.
	**Vault**. Whenever you use Flurry of Blows, you can vault up to 15 feet without provoking an attack of opportunity, instead of applying one of the normal effects.

**Damage**: 1d6 (1d8)  

**Damage Type**: Bludgeoning

**Properties**: Versatile

**Weight**: 4
