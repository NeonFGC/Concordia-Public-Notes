The City Watch of Pentara is an ancient group, tasked with the defence of the city in times of war, and the maintaining of law and order in times of peace. They wear dark blue tabards over chain shirts, marked with the symbol of [[Pentara]]. They usually carry a spear and shield, with a short sword at their hips.
