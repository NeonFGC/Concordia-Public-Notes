House Goodbarrel is a halfling merchant dynasty that rose from humble roots during the Silent Age. Once grain and spice traders, they are now one of the wealthiest and most influential families in [[index|Concordia]]. Their success was built on clever business, fair dealing and uncanny timing, turning river barges and market stalls into a sprawling network of shipping, finance and trade ventures.

House Goodbarrel maintains strong standing in Pentara, led by [[Matilda Tilly Goodbarrel]], now later in years but as sharp as ever, preferring her rooftop garden office overlooking the merchant quarter where she receives visitors over tea and biscuits. Her laughter is famous, her memory flawless, and her influence undeniable. 
Her children have expanded the family's stretch across almost every industry.
