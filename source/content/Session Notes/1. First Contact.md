# Harvest Festival
The party arrived at the [[Lantern Harvest]], in the [[Sapphire Square]]. 
Taking a look around, [[Bryan]] decided to try some Fairywine, which turned out to be far stronger than anything he had previously tried, causing him to see some fairies off in the distance. He won a toy hammer attempting a strength challenge.
During this, [[Res]] notices some shifty individuals and decides to have his fortune read. The Fortune Teller informs him that someone that he knows and loves very much will die. 
[[Quartztopher]] awkwardly heads to the fountain, climbs up and steals one of the loose crystals. A small group of children draw an image of chalk on his shell.
Over on the other side, [[Brokk]] is knocking down various barrels and crates, like a large bull in a small china shop. He quickly grabbed 5 dragon pepper skewers and wolfed them down.
[[Tealeaf]] immediately sized up the local population, and witnessed a local noble getting pickpocketed by someone in a shimmering grey cloak, and a silver half-mask. 

A little while later, [[Bryan]], [[Quartztopher]] and [[Brokk]] took part in the drinking contest, hosted by [[Tobias Merren]]. None of them won and [[Brokk]] threw up in his helm. [[Tobias Merren|Tobias]] takes a liking to [[Quartztopher]] and tells them to come by later if they need a place to stay.

As the sun began to set, people gathered around the fountain for the launch of the lanterns, and as [[Quartztopher]] the gem he brought with him pickpocketed without him noticing. As excitement rippled through the crowd, the group experienced something whisper to them.

*"It's time to remember"

As the groups eyes are drawn to each other, [[Brokk]] starts knocking his helmet, assuming that the voice is in his head. [[Tealeaf]] starts jamming alongside as she whipped out her bongo drums. The group made their introductions to each other.
# Ambush!

Deciding to head to [[The Board and Barrel]], the group are ambushed by a group of bandits in an alleyway. Handling themselves more than capably, [[Quartztopher]] beheads one of the bandits.

Some guards come over to arrest the remaining bandits, and one of them ([[Donald Stonesworn]]) informed them that they should go and see [[Maribel Thornwhistle]] for some work, at [[The Cloak and Coin]].
# Back at the Inn...
The group engage in some friendly banter with some locals, [[Tealeaf]] did some performances of various success, and the group learn of [[The Silver Web]], a local thieving gang who have become far more bold in recent years. The group decided to split up tomorrow to run some errands before meeting at [[The Cloak and Coin]].
[[Res]] found out that [[Kallista Starflare]] gave a lecture recently in the city, but has since left.
