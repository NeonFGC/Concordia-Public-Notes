# Harvest Festival
The party arrived at the [[Lantern Harvest]], in the [[Sapphire Square]]. 
Taking a look around, [[Bryan]] decided to try some Fairywine, which turned out to be far stronger than anything he had previously tried, causing him to see some fairies off in the distance. He won a toy hammer attempting a strength challenge.
During this, [[Res]] notices some shifty individuals and decides to have his fortune read. The Fortune Teller informs him that someone that he knows and loves very much will die. 
[[Quartztopher]] awkwardly heads to the fountain, climbs up and steals one of the loose crystals. A small group of children draw an image of chalk on his shell.
Over on the other side, [[Brokk]] is knocking down various barrels and crates, like a large bull in a small china shop. He quickly grabbed 5 dragon pepper skewers and wolfed them down.
[[Tealeaf]] immediately sized up the local population, and witnessed a local noble getting pickpocketed by someone in a shimmering grey cloak, and a silver half-mask. 

A little while later, [[Bryan]], [[Quartztopher]] and [[Brokk]] took part in the drinking contest, hosted by [[Tobias Merren]]. None of them won and [[Brokk]] threw up in his helm. [[Tobias Merren|Tobias]] takes a liking to [[Quartztopher]] and tells them to come by later if they need a place to stay.
