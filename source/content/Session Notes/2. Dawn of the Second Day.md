# Temple District
The next morning, [[Res]], [[People/Bryan]] and [[Tealeaf]] headed to the [[Temple Heights]], where [[People/Bryan]] tossed a coin into the Fountain in the centre, and gained the blessing of [[The Serene - Ishtar, Voice of Still Waters|Ishtar]] herself. 
The crew noted a statue dedicated to [[Ser Eldric Solarith]].
[[People/Bryan]] was able to deliver his letter to [[Neressa Vhal]], who after reading it became extremely concerned and disappeared deeper into the archives of the Church of [[The Serene - Ishtar, Voice of Still Waters|Ishtar]].

# Kazrak's
Meanwhile, [[People/Brokk]] and [[Quartztopher]] went to [[Kazrak & Kin Jewelsteel Consortium]], to visit [[Kazrak Gemthane]], who is something of a father figure to [[People/Brokk]]. After a stranger than usual introduction, [[Quartztopher]] sold the crystal he had stolen the previous day to [[Kazrak Gemthane|Kazrak]], who in turn informed the pair that he has recently had a shipment of blueprints and diagrams go missing, and would pay handsomely should they come across it.

# At the Cloak and Coin
The two groups met back up at [[The Cloak and Coin]], and had their first meeting with [[Maribel Thornwhistle|Maribel]]. She gave the group a task to go and clear out some Goblins, who had overran a small farm to the south of [[Pentara]].

# Goblin Slayer
The group arrived at the abandoned farm, and engaged the Goblins in combat. After a hard fought battle in which [[Tealeaf]], [[Res]] and [[People/Bryan]] got downed, the group succeeded in clearing out the goblins. Exploring the farm a little more, the group discovered a secret basement underneath the house, in which they found a tunnel entrance to the sewers, as well as a ledger containing many outgoing transactions to [[House Drake]].
Upon exiting the house, they came across a small travelling merchant gnome, selling jars of pickled cabbages. The crew decided to purchase one each, only to discover they had incredible magical properties.
Looting the farm, [[Quartztopher]] took the head of the Goblin chief, and [[People/Brokk]] found the crystal that had been stolen the day before.
