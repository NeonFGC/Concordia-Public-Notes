# Attack of the Druids
Investigating the guard, it shortly becomes clear that the camp is under attack by the druids of [[Stonebrook]]. A fierce battle ensues and [[Orimis Vaeloras]] is felled by [[Quartztopher]] after revealing himself to be the son of [[House Vaeloras]]. A knight of the [[The Order of the Pale]] by the name of [[William Marshall]] duelled a druid and won the king of the hill game.

With both the druids and the order defeated, the party head back to their boat to continue their adventure.
