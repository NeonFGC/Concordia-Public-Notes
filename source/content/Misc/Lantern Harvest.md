The yearly Lantern Harvest festival is put on every year by [[House Goodbarrel]], in reverance to the Goddess [[The Blooming Mother - Lysara, Heart of the Harvest|Lysara]]. Hosted in the [[Sapphire Square]], it is seen by the people of [[Pentara]] as an opportunity for not only for fun and games, but also for reflection and giving thanks.
As the sun sets above the crystal fountain, paper lanterns are let loose into the sky, carrying with them the hopes and prayers of the people, as well as the names of those that were lost during the year.
