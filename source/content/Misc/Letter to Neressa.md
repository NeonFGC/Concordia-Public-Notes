Neressa,

May the Still Waters keep your hand steady and your thoughts clear. I trust your days remain peaceful, or as close to peaceful as these times permit. Our patrols along the eastern edge of Pentara continue, and although the land feels tense in subtle ways, all remains manageable.

I write to speak of the subject we studied together in earlier years, the one that lingered in our conversations despite the uncertainty of the old accounts. While traveling with a small escort through a seldom used pass, I encountered a fragment that carries the qualities described in those records. Its form is unusual, and although it appears unremarkable to those without context, it struck me immediately as something worth setting aside.

The fragment is now secured and kept away from unnecessary attention. I have made no mention of its nature. It seems wiser to allow it to pass as a simple curiosity until you and I can examine it with the care it deserves. I believe your knowledge of the earliest catalogued materials will prove invaluable in determining whether this is truly what we once considered only theoretical.

When your duties next bring you toward the northern roads, send a discreet message ahead of your arrival. I will arrange for a meeting place that offers privacy and quiet, for matters such as this are often misunderstood by those who lack the patience for study.

May Ishtar guide your path and your work,  
Seraphine Valenor
High Priestess of the Order of the Pail
